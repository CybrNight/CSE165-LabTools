# CSE165-LabTools

Tools used for generating lab structure and grading labs for CSE165 at UC Merced. This project started as a simple bash script to generate my lab folders, but quickly evolved into a program intended for not only building the lab structure, but also grading the labs to improve demo times. 

## Features
