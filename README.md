[![Pre-release](https://github.com/CybrNight/CSE165-LabTools/actions/workflows/auto_release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CybrNight/CSE165-LabTools/actions/workflows/auto_release.yml)

Tools used for generating lab structure and grading labs for CSE165 at UC Merced.
Let's hope the professor lets me implement this so we don't end up with 2 hour demo waits again.
