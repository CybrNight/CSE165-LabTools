[![Pre-release](https://github.com/CybrNight/CSE165-LabTools/actions/workflows/bleeding_edge.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CybrNight/CSE165-LabTools/actions/workflows/bleeding_edge.yml)

Tools used for generating lab structure and grading labs for CSE165 at UC Merced. This project started as a simple bash script to generate my lab folders, but quickly evolved into a program intended for not only building the lab structure, but also grading the labs to improve demo times. 

## Features
 - Auto generate lab folder structure per the professor's requirements
 - Grade labs based on user-defined test cases (Incoming)
